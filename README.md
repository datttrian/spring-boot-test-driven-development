Writing code that can easily be tested—early and often—can not only help you achieve higher quality code, but can do so with repeatable patterns that get executed in your build and deployment processes. Practicing test-driven development can help you speed up your software release cycles, and ensure that you end up with a high-quality product. In this course, Frank Moley shows you how to write Spring-based Java applications that follow a test-driven development pattern to help achieve higher-quality code quickly. He gives you an overview of general test-driven development practices in Spring, looks at unit testing in a Spring application, uses mock objects to unit test, integrates testing with Spring, and more. Frank provides challenges and solutions throughout the course, so you can practice what you’ve learned along the way.
